# Car Rental - Hire or Rent Yours

This app allows you to search for renting vehicles or renting out yours. Notable features include specifying a start and end date duration for your hire, account management via authentication and authorization and renting out your vehicle. Sign in to access features that are not available to guests, e.g. profile picture upload and maintain a hires list.

The technologies used are: Next js, Typescript, Bootstrap and [more](https://github.com/AtGbemiga/car-rental-frontend/blob/main/package.json)

The Backend is written in Node.js and hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions), 
to safely store the API-Key while accessing the API.
